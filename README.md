# CS50-Homepage

This is the webpage I made to complete the CS50x Homepage assignment. I played around a bit with codes and their syntaxes.
Texts used in this repository were mainly written by me. For exceptions, they are noted with quotation marks.

I have just started to venture into this community with a love for typing with my blue switch keyboard. Any advice and/or help is always greatly appreciated.
I can be contacted via email at hsua02466@gmail.com

This is probably the most informal and incorrect readme doc ever but I guess I am allowed to do dumb things as a newbie.

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.
