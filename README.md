# CS50-Homepage

This is the webpage I made to complete the CS50x Homepage assignment. I played around a bit with codes and their syntaxes.
Texts used in this repository were mainly written by me. For exceptions, they are noted with quotation marks.

I am just venturing into this community with a love for typing with my blue switch keyboard, so any advice and/or help is always greatly appreciated.
I can be contacted via email at hsua02466@gmail.com

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.
